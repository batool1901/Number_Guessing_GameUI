# Number_Guessing_GameUI
Welcome to "Guess My Number", a fun and interactive game built using **Java Swing GUI**. This project showcases my understanding of Java fundamentals, GUI design, and event-driven programming.

What’s the Game About?
In this classic number guessing game:
* The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.
* You have "10 attempts" to guess the correct number.
* After each guess, the game gives you a hint:
  * Too low 
  * Too high
  * Correct! 
* Each correct guess gives you a "score based on remaining attempts".
* The game continues for "multiple rounds", and your "total score" is tracked.
* A stylish "game over screen" shows your final score and a thank-you message.

Features:
✨Modern UI: Designed using "Java Swing" with gradient backgrounds and styled components
🎯Random Number Generator: Random number between 1 and 100 each round
🔢Attempts Counter: Tracks how many tries are left
🏆Scoring System: Earn points based on how quickly you guess
📊Multi-Round Gameplay: Automatically moves to the next round after success or failure
🖼️Custom Popups: Clean and themed popups for round results and game over
🎨Colorful Fonts & Layout: Eye-catching visuals and clear feedback for users
